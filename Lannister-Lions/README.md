## Team Leader Email - [Nikhil Bansal](mailto:nikhil@example.com)

## A Brief of the Prototype:
The platform seamlessly integrates the capabilities of oneAPI and Intel technologies to empower legal professionals with advanced tools. Lawyers, upon login, gain access to a personalized dashboard presenting a detailed profile summary, including statistics on cases won, cases lost, and ongoing cases. Leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique backed by oneAPI, specific cases unfold with context-rich information, enhancing the lawyer's insights.

Furthermore, a sophisticated chat module, underpinned by our finely-tuned LLAMA-2 model and powered by Intel technologies, facilitates technical discussions on legal matters. The integration of oneAPI ensures optimized performance, scalability, and efficiency throughout the platform. This technical synergy of oneAPI, Intel technologies, RAG, and LLAMA-2 not only elevates the lawyer's ability to efficiently manage cases but also establishes a secure and technologically advanced environment for legal practitioners.
